# Optimizing-Medication-Effectiveness To Reduce Readmission in the Healthcare Industy
In this group project, we explored how different medications in the management of diabetes can impact hospital readmission by analysis of a real patient dataset. Using the data we determined trends that would guide more tailored and optimized effective treatment stratergies.

This project was carried out collaboratively by the team. All members actively participated in the design, execution, and analysis stages, ensuring that contributions were shared across data processing, visualization, and report preparation.

## Project Details
We analyzed a dataset of aggregated diabetes care records from 130 U.S. hospitals, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contained attributes relevant to diabetic patient care and readmission outcomes.

The data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to ensure accuracy and usability. For this, we used Python libraries (such as Pandas) to remove errors, prepare the data, and support statistical analysis. Key metrics were computed, and patterns were identified to better understand patient readmissions.

Visualizations were created using Python libraries, allowing us to present trends and findings clearly. These visual insights supported the interpretation of results and informed recommendations for improving diabetes care management.

## Project Report 
The report consists of:
📊 Analysis Conducted – processed and examined the diabetes dataset to extract meaningful information.

📈 Detailed Visualizations – created charts and graphs to highlight patterns and trends.

📉 Statistical Findings – computed key metrics and identified relationships within the data, such as readmission rates.

💡 Actionable Insights – uncovered insights to guide improvements in diabetes care management.

📝 Considerable Recommendations – proposed strategies for healthcare providers to reduce readmissions and enhance patient outcomes
